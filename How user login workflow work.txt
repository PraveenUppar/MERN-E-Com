 summary of the flow:

- A user submits a login form, which triggers the handleLogin function.
- handleLogin calls the login mutation function (from the RTK Query hook).
- The mutation function uses the login endpoint definition to send a POST request to your server's /api/users/login endpoint with the user's data.
- The server processes the request and sends back a response, hopefully with the user's details.
- If the response is successful, the handleLogin function dispatches the setCredentials action.
- The setCredentials reducer function then updates the Redux state with the user's info and also saves the info (and an expiration time) to local storage.
- Finally, the user is redirected to the home page, and a success message is shown.
