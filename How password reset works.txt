Step 1: User Initiates Password Reset (Frontend)

- The user visits the "Forgot Password" page on your website (the frontend).
- They enter their email address into a form and click "Submit."
- The frontend (using JavaScript like fetch or a library like Axios) sends a POST request to a specific backend API endpoint, for example: POST /api/users/forgotPassword.
- The request body contains the user's email address.
- Connection Point: The frontend's JavaScript initiates the entire process by making an API call to the backend.

Step 2: The Backend Processes the Request

-  backend server (e.g., a Node.js/Express application) receives the POST request at the /api/users/forgotPassword route.
- The backend's route handler extracts the email address from the request body.
- The backend queries the database to find the user associated with that email.

Step 3: Backend Security and Token Generation

- This is the most critical part of the process.
- Generate a Secure Token: The backend uses a cryptographic library (like Node.js's built-in crypto module) to generate a secure, random string of characters. This is the original, unhashed token.
- Store a Hashed Token: The backend then hashes this token using a secure, one-way algorithm (like SHA-256). It stores this hashed token and an expiration timestamp (e.g., 10 minutes from now) on the user's document in the database.
- Why Hashing? This is a key security measure. If your database were ever compromised, the attacker would only have the hashed token, which is useless for resetting a password. The original, unhashed token is never stored in the database.
- Connection Point: The backend uses the database to securely store the token's hash and expiration.

Step 4: Backend Engages Nodemailer

- This is where Nodemailer comes in. The backend uses Nodemailer as a module to send the email.
- The backend calls a utility function, like your sendEmail function.
- It passes the user's email and the original, unhashed token as arguments to this function.

Nodemailer's Role:

- The sendEmail function uses nodemailer.createTransport to connect to your configured email service (e.g., a Gmail SMTP server, using credentials from your environment variables).
- It constructs the email message, including the subject and body.
- The email body contains a special link: The backend creates a full URL that points back to a frontend page and includes the original, unhashed token as a URL parameter. For example: https://your-app.com/reset-password?token=ABC123XYZ.
- transporter.sendMail() is called, and Nodemailer sends the email to the user via the email service.
- Connection Point: The backend uses the unhashed token to create a unique URL and then uses Nodemailer to send this URL to the user.

Step 5: User Receives the Email and Submits a New Password

- The user receives the email and clicks the unique password reset link.
- The link takes them to a page on your frontend (e.g., /reset-password).
- The frontend automatically extracts the token from the URL and displays a form for the user to enter their new password.
- The user enters and confirms their new password and clicks "Submit."
- The frontend makes another API call to the backend, for example: PATCH /api/users/resetPassword/:token. The request body contains the new password.
- Connection Point: The frontend receives the unhashed token from the URL and sends it, along with the new password, back to the backend.

Step 6: Final Backend Validation and Password Update

- The backend receives the PATCH request. It extracts the token from the URL parameter and the new password from the request body.
- It hashes the token from the URL.
- It queries the database to find a user whose document's hashed token matches the one from the URL and is not expired.

If the token is valid:
- The backend takes the new password provided by the user and hashes it with a strong algorithm like bcrypt.
- It updates the user's password field in the database with the new, securely hashed password.
- It also clears the passwordResetToken and passwordResetExpires fields from the user's document to invalidate the token.
- It saves the changes to the database and sends a success response to the frontend.
-sIf the token is invalid or expired:

The backend sends an error response to the frontend.
