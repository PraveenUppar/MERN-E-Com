The Characters in Our Story

- You (The App Developer): The one who built the restaurant.
- The Customer (The User): The person who wants to eat.
- The Menu (API Endpoints): The list of all the dishes the kitchen can make. For example: "Get All Users," "Login," "Register," etc.
- The Kitchen (apiSlice.js): This is the core of the restaurant. It has the stove, the fridges, and the team that knows how to cook. It's a special, high-tech kitchen that can handle many orders at once, knows which ones are for fetching data and which ones are for making changes, and can even remember a popular dish so it doesn't have to cook it from scratch every time. This kitchen is connected to the outside world to get ingredients (the BASE_URL).
- The Kitchen's Specialized Teams (userApiSlice.js, productsApiSlice.js): These are the teams in the kitchen. One team only handles orders for "Users" (login, register), another only for "Products," and so on. They all report to the main kitchen (apiSlice) but focus on their own special dishes.
- The Hostess/Cashier (userSlice.js): This person's job is to greet the customer, remember who they are, and keep track of their table number and if they've paid. They keep a note on a little notepad (localStorage) so even if the customer leaves and comes back, they can remember them.
- The Central Manager (store.js): This person is in charge of the entire restaurant. They manage the kitchen, the hostess, and the cashier. When a customer walks in and places an order, the manager makes sure the right person handles it.
- The Waiter (useLoginMutation() hook): This is a special, super-efficient waiter. They take the customer's order for a specific dish ("Login"), run to the kitchen, and come back with the result. They also give you updates on their progress ("I'm getting the order now," "The order is ready," "Oops, the kitchen made a mistake").

The Story: A User Logs In

A new Customer comes to your app and goes to the "Login" page.

The Waiter (useLoginMutation()) stands ready to take the order.

The Customer enters their username and password and tells the Waiter, "I want to log in with this information."

The Waiter immediately takes the order and runs to the Kitchen's Specialized Team for "Users."

The "Users" team receives the order and knows exactly what to do. They send a request to the outside world (the server) to verify the login details. While they wait for a response, the Waiter tells the Customer, "I'm checking your order now" (isLoading: true).

The outside world responds: "Yes, this person is a verified customer! Here is their information."

The "Users" team gives the information back to the Waiter. The Waiter's status changes to "Success! Here's your information" (data: { ... }, isLoading: false).

The Waiter hands this information to the Central Manager (dispatch).

The Manager sees this information and gives it to the Hostess/Cashier (userSlice).

The Hostess/Cashier takes the information, remembers who the customer is, and writes their name down on their notepad (localStorage). They now know this person is an official customer.

From now on, any part of the restaurant (any component) can ask the Hostess/Cashier who the customer is, and the Hostess/Cashier will know the answer. And if a customer wants to look at a list of products, the Waiter will take that order directly to the "Products" team in the Kitchen, completely separate from the Hostess.
