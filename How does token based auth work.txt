The generateToken function is designed to handle the core task of creating and securely storing an authentication token for a user.

Think of it as a two-step process:

Token Creation: 
- The function first generates a JSON Web Token (JWT). This token is like a digital ID card for the user. 
- It contains the user's unique ID and is "signed" with a secret key. This signature is a security measure that ensures the token hasn't been tampered with. 
- It's also given an expiration date, so it's only valid for a limited time (in this case, one day).

Token Storage: 
- After creating the token, the function doesn't just return it. Instead, it places the token directly into a cookie on the user's web browser. 
- The function sets special security flags on this cookie (httpOnly, secure, sameSite) to ensure the token is protected from common attacks and is only sent with authorized requests.
